# Impact-of-car-features-on-Price
This project aims to analyse a comprehensive dataset of car models, their specifications, and pricing information to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies and product development efforts.
Business Problem:
The main objective of this project is to assist a car manufacturer in
optimizing pricing and product development decisions. The manufacturer
wants to identify the factors that drive consumer demand for cars and
determine how to set prices and develop products that maximize
profitability while meeting consumer expectations.

Data Sources:
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on over 11,000 car
models, including their make, model, year, fuel type, engine power,
transmission, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon,
popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). The dataset
is obtained from reliable sources such as automotive industry databases
and market research reports.

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:
Before analysing the dataset, thorough data cleaning and pre-processing
are performed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. This
includes handling missing data, removing duplicates, standardizing
variable formats, and addressing any inconsistencies. The cleaned dataset
is then used for further analysis.

Conclusion â€“
The project aims to provide actionable insights to the car manufacturer based on
the analysis of the dataset. The findings can assist in optimizing pricing
strategies, identifying key features to focus on in product development, and
understanding consumer preferences within different market categories. By
leveraging data-driven decision-making, the car manufacturer can enhance
profitability and competitive advantage in the dynamic automotive industry.
